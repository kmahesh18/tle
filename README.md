## üìã Overview

TLE Manager is a comprehensive web application for teachers and coaches to track their students' performance on Codeforces. The name "TLE" is a play on "Time Limit Exceeded," a common verdict in competitive programming, but here it stands for "Track, Learn, Excel" - reflecting the app's purpose of helping instructors monitor student progress.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Component Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/        # Reusable UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/             # Main application pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ store/             # Zustand state stores
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/             # Utility functions and API client
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/            # Static assets and images
```

### State Management

TLE Manager uses Zustand with persistence middleware for state management:

- **StudentStore**: Manages student data, including adding, updating, and deleting students
- **ThemeStore**: Handles theme preferences (dark/light mode)
- **SettingsStore**: Manages application settings like sync frequency and email configurations

### Codeforces API Integration

The application uses the Codeforces API to fetch:

- User information (handle, rating, rank)
- Submission history
- Contest participation
- Problem-solving statistics

## üìä Dashboard & Analytics

### Student Overview

The dashboard provides a quick glance at all students with key metrics:

- Current and max ratings
- Activity status
- Reminder counts
- Problem-solving statistics

### Student Profile

Each student has a detailed profile page with:

1. **Overview Tab**

   - Rating progress chart
   - Activity statistics
   - Problem distribution by difficulty

2. **Progress Tab**

   - Monthly solved problem trends
   - Problem rating breakdown
   - Tag distribution analysis

3. **Problems Tab**

   - List of solved problems
   - Filtering by difficulty, tags, and date
   - Problem ratings and categories

4. **Contests Tab**
   - Contest participation history
   - Rating changes visualization
   - Performance statistics

## üîÑ Synchronization System

TLE Manager provides two ways to sync data with Codeforces:

1. **Manual Sync**

   - Individual student sync from their profile page
   - Immediate update of all student metrics

2. **Scheduled Sync**
   - Set automatic sync frequency (daily/weekly)
   - Configure preferred sync time
   - Background updates without user intervention

## üìß Notification System

The application can send email reminders to inactive students:

- Configure SMTP settings for mail server
- Set reminder threshold (days of inactivity)
- View and track sent reminder counts
- Toggle email notifications per student

## üì± Responsive Design

TLE Manager is designed to work seamlessly across all devices:

- **Desktop**: Full-featured dashboard with expanded analytics views
- **Tablet**: Responsive grid layouts that adapt to medium screen sizes
- **Mobile**: Collapsible menus and touch-optimized interfaces
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Automatic theme switching based on system preferences or manual toggle

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Components are loaded on demand to minimize initial load time
- **Memoization**: Frequently used calculations are cached to avoid redundant operations
- **Lazy Loading**: Images and charts are loaded only when they enter the viewport
- **Debounced Search**: Search operations are debounced to minimize API calls
- **Virtualized Lists**: Long lists use virtualization to maintain smooth scrolling
- **Local Storage**: Efficient data persistence using browser's local storage

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Data Isolation**: All user data is stored locally, not on remote servers
- **No Backend**: No server-side credentials or personal data storage
- **API Limitations**: Respects Codeforces API rate limits to prevent abuse
- **No Tracking**: No user analytics or tracking scripts included

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kmahesh18/tle.git
   cd tle
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Build for production
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Using TLE Manager

#### Adding Students

1. Click the "Add Student" button in the dashboard
2. Enter the student's Codeforces handle
3. Optionally add contact information (email, phone)
4. Submit to fetch and save their data

#### Syncing Data

1. Navigate to a student's profile
2. Click the "Sync Data" button to update their information
3. Or configure automatic syncing in Settings

#### Configuring Settings

1. Navigate to the Settings page
2. Set your preferred sync frequency and time
3. Configure email notification settings
4. Manage data export and import options

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **API Rate Limiting**: If you're adding many students at once, you might hit Codeforces API rate limits. Wait a few minutes before trying again.
- **Local Storage Limits**: Browsers typically limit local storage to 5-10MB. If you're tracking many students, consider exporting data regularly.
- **Data Not Syncing**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection when syncing student data.
- **Chart Rendering Issues**: If charts aren't rendering properly, try refreshing the page or switching between tabs.

### Browser Compatibility

TLE Manager works best on modern browsers:

- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)

## üìù Notes on Data Storage

TLE Manager uses browser local storage to persist data. This means:

- Data remains available between sessions
- No server-side storage is required
- Data is limited to the browser's local storage capacity
- Data is not shared between devices

For team usage, consider exporting data regularly or implementing a backend server.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Planned features for future releases:

- **Multi-platform API Integration**: Support for other competitive programming platforms like AtCoder and LeetCode
- **Team Management**: Group students into classes or teams for better organization
- **Advanced Analytics**: More sophisticated performance metrics and predictive analytics
- **Cloud Sync**: Optional cloud storage for team collaboration
- **PWA Support**: Progressive Web App functionality for offline access
